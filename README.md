# 2400GE-Coreboot
This is a repository that I have created to document everything that I do and learn along the way while learning how to make coreboot work on the AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 2400GE on the Lenovo ThinkCentre M715Q. There is a lack of reference on this processor on this specific board and the documentation for different implementations of coreboot doesn't really touch on this.
